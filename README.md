Presentation, references and demonstration code for Drupalcon Copenhagen 2010 
"Connecting Drupal" session: http://cph2010.drupal.org/sessions/connect-drupal

« Ever came across a Drupal-project, where data was not simply inserted into Drupal forms and printed as HTML-pages? Where you wanted to:

* Pull data into Drupal, that lives on a remote service? Such as data in, say, Facebook, or on a RESTfull NoSQL database.
* Use statuses, information or authentication over the web? Such as XMPP statuses, XMLRPC information, OAuth.
* Push data into remote services? For example when you use Drupal to manage the data in a remote service.
* Use Drupal to offer your own services and API's? Such as content in your Drupal database made available for use in other sites.
